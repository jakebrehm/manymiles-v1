*ManyMiles* aims to provide an easy and user-friendly way to track and analyze vehicle mileage. To make it even easier to add records from other sources, a REST API is also provided.

Check out the website [here](https://www.manymiles.app), and check out my personal Siri Shortcut [here](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/3da05ad93cbe417cb12ee8f9922f0654) if you're on iOS.

## Inspiration

At the time of starting this project, I'd been on a lease for my car for nearly two years. I'm a data fanatic, so I'd log my car's mileage in a Google Sheet daily to see how I'm doing compared to my lease's mileage limit. Tired of wasting 30 seconds messing around with a spreadsheet, I decided to spend a couple dozen hours building a website that would make it take 10 seconds instead!

My *real* endgoal was a Siri Shortcut that would allow me to record my daily mileage hands-free by just speaking to my phone; essentially, this meant that I needed some kind of API to interact with a database. A nice-looking website, the accompanying analysis, and the web development experience were definitely positives though.
