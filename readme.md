The aim of *ManyMiles* is to provide an easy and user-friendly way to track vehicle mileage, as well as provide statistics and an analysis of that data. It also provides a REST API that makes it easy to add records from other sources, such as a Siri Shortcut.

Check out the website [here](https://www.manymiles.app), and check out my personal Siri Shortcut [here](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/3da05ad93cbe417cb12ee8f9922f0654) if you're on iOS.

## Inspiration

At the time of starting this project, I'd been on a lease for my car for nearly two years. I've always been a data fanatic, so I would log my car's mileage in a Google Sheet daily in order to see how I'm doing compared to my lease's mileage limit. I got tired of wasting 30 seconds per day opening the spreadsheet and adding to it, so I decided to spend a couple dozen hours building a website that would make it take 10 seconds instead!

My *real* endgoal was a Siri Shortcut that would allow me to record my daily mileage hands-free by just speaking to my phone; essentially, this meant that I needed some kind of API to interact with a database. A nice-looking website, the accompanying analysis, and the web development experience were definitely positives though.
